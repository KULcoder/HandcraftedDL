# HandcraftedML
In order to better understand different machine learning & deep learning models, I try to implement models from scratch.

## Traditional Machine Learning Models
Try to implement all traditional machine learning models with consistent format, so they will be easy to test and demonstrate.

## Deep Learning Models
For deep learning models, I use `PyTorch` to avoid the calculation of back-prop and derivatives. All implemented models are directly to use like any other `PyTorch` models.

## Dependency
- `PyTorch`
- `NumPy`
